If my heart seemed to flutter when you walked in
Don't worry, I have a murmur, it was probably palpiations
And the shortness of breath was just the asthma acting up
No the color that tinged my cheeks was not a blush
Perhaps my rosatia, or too much to drink
It must have been vertigo when the world seemed to spin
And a mania as time stood still
